## Learnings

In Python 3.8 you can make variable assignments in expressions like

`if (my_var := len(x) > 5)`

Large integers can be entered using '_' where commas would go so they're easier to read. For example, instead of
entering 1 million as 1000000, we can use 1_000_000.

*linked lists* - These are useful when you have unique sequential data and you can even make them "loop" around. (See
problem 23.)
